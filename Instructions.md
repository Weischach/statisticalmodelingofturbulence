# statisticalmodelingofturbulence


1. Run autospec_BendatPiersol.m in Matlab to see how autospectrum is extracted from a wind database. 
2. A sample wind data file is provided, and it will be processed by the Matlab code by assigning mnum = 9.
3. The CNN model is MultiparaCNN-KFold.ipynb. 
4. Similarly, the LSTM model is LSTM-Kfold-minicurve.ipynb
5. The LSTM model can be compared with the perturbation series results using the Matlab file compare_nnmodel_minicurve.m.
